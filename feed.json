Jude Kerr here, me and Thor (Petridisch) really liked the idea of making a big blog post about the Chosen Persons remix album for you all to be able to read and sip your coffee to.</p>\n<p>Anyway, without further we do! Here is the Chosen Trivia, is that a good name?</p>\n<h1>#1</h1>\n<p>The EP art is a picture inside the hall of my house in Wishaw, Scotland. The lamp was a recent little purchase from my maw and it's meant to resemble an astronaut. I sent six photos over for ideas one of them being this photo here:</p>\n<div class=\"npf_row\">\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full post__image post__image--center\" data-orig-height=\"480\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/7242e5e5dc83453c800b6aa379546cb9/cf00fe665f02edfd-99/s640x960/40333127605378dfde89116c8af31f8629dc8fcb.pnj\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" srcset=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/7242e5e5dc83453c800b6aa379546cb9/cf00fe665f02edfd-99/s640x960/40333127605378dfde89116c8af31f8629dc8fcb.pnj 640w\" alt=\"The first original photo of the astronaut lamp that would inspire the photo pictured on the remix album &quot;Chosen Persons&quot; by Caer Sgàil and Petridisch.

That would ultimately lead to me offering the full EP to him which I love that we got something out of it because I absolutely love Chosen Persons and can't imagine a world without it.</p>\n<h1>#4</h1>\n<p>The vantage point of the back cover of Chosen Persons is not unknown to Petridisch (or his work for that matter). The particular view of the Boston skyline from his apartment porch has featured in some form or another on at least two other projects of his.

Imagine an alternate universe Caer Sgàil that ended up having that as the album name haha.</p>\n<h1>#6</h1>\n<p>The limited edition 2025 cassette tape release features two tracks:</p>\n<p><strong>A. Chosen Persons (Continuous Album Mix)</strong><br><strong>B. Moon Cycles</strong></p>\n<p>\"Moon Cycles\" came from when Petridisch sent me the photo of the mock-up \"Side B\" of the tape and I made a comment because he sent me the image but flipped and make a little joke out of the idea that it's also a reversed version which was exactly what he'd do!</p>\n<p>It sounds oddly good? Which is funny to me but I love it!</p>\n<p>The track name for Side B is not even named on the tape or anywhere! This is your first official source saying this.</p>\n<p>Original title ideas were</p>\n<ul>\n<li>snosreP nesohC (Jude)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbrxaTkFFbk\">Up the Hill Backwards</a> (Petridisch - inspired by David Bowie)</li>\n<li>Mooncircles (Petridisch)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The name \"Moon Cycles\" is inspired by the album art! The art is a picture of an \"Astronaut\" lamp, which is the main inspiration for me to pitch the \"Moon Cycles\" name. It is inspired by the art also the fact that Moon Cycles (or phases) are a very real thing that influence tides and Earth's stability through gravity, and affect biological rhythms in many organisms, such as triggering reproduction and migration.</p>\n<p>Moon cycles also influence Earth’s tides and help stabilise the planet’s tilt, which keeps our seasons and climate steady.</p>\n<h1><strong>Thank You!</strong></h1>\n<p>That's all our facts (for now!)
